              Increasing prosperity in our lives can be accomplished by having
              the right frame of mind. The truth is, our thoughts are very
              powerful. >They are capable of influencing every aspect of our
              daily lives, from our physical health to our social behaviors. I’m
              sure you’ve heard the adage, “As you think, so shall you be.” If
              we want to improve our lives, we must first improve our thoughts.
              Harnessing the power of thought in a positive way has the ability
              to create great change in our lives, including our financial
              well-being and prosperity. But how? How do we take something as
              intangible as thoughts, and manifest them into a physical reality?
              We must first understand that being prosperous is more than having
              a lot of money. Prosperity is a mindset, a way of interacting in
              our lives, and a way of thinking. Mastering this train of thought
              is not easy, but it is simple enough if we keep working on it
              consistently. Following are some ideas to help you improve your
              thoughts, and ultimately attract more prosperity into your life:
              Be grateful for the blessings in your life right now. Take a few
              minutes each day to express heartfelt gratitude for the good
              things in your life. Even more powerful, write a few of these
              blessings down each day. This helps to put your focus in the right
              direction — on abundance, not lack. Use positive affirmations to
              begin training yourself to think positively. Use “I am” statements
              such as “I am worthy of all that is good.” Write the statements
              down and repeat them nightly before bed. Over time, this will
              implant these thoughts into your subconscious mind, and you will
              begin to naturally believe them. Creative visualization can help
              you achieve prosperity by determining what it is you wish to
              achieve, and then thoroughly creating that image in your mind.
              This works in the same way affirmations do. Our subconscious will
              fill with images of prosperity, and eventually these subconscious
              “truths” will manifest in the physical. “See” yourself as being
              prosperous, and you will become so. Encourage yourself with the
              belief that you can achieve great things. This could also be one
              of your affirmations, but expand on it. If you know you can earn a
              certain salary, tell yourself you can earn more. Allow yourself to
              believe all things are possible, and you will gain the confidence
              needed to reach higher than you ever imagined you could. If you
              believe you can do it, you are more likely to take the risks
              associated with people who are highly successful. Prosperity and
              success go hand in hand, so take risks and aim higher. Start a
              savings account. As strange as it sounds, think about this: Like
              Attracts Like. Even if you can only afford to put a few dollars
              into your account every month, it will begin to build up and
              attract more money. Finally, believe you are already wealthy. The
              creative ability of our thoughts is such that we lend more power
              and energy to whatever we consistently focus on. Focusing on lack
              will create more lack. Focusing on wealth and prosperity will
              create . . . guess what? Remember that this is a process. You
              likely won’t change your circumstances in one day. But over time,
              with consistent focus, your thoughts will begin to attract what
              you want. Once you master this power of thought, there are truly
              no limits to what you can create!

              Successful businesses have many things in common, today we’ll look
              at the big ‘R’ of recognition and how a digital advertising
              network may help. Recognition can be illustrated by two
              individuals entering a crowded room at a party. Both walk to the
              far side of the room, one of them slips through the crowd easily
              and unnoticed as they reach the far side. The second person takes
              much longer to reach the far side because they are engaged in
              conversations along the way as they continue to meet acquaintances
              and friends during their path. Which type of person would you like
              to model your business after? Your business is in a continual
              battle for your customers’ recognition whether you know it or not.
              If you happen to be fortunate enough to be in a marketplace with
              very few competitors, that will not last for long. You need your
              business to be at the forefront of your client’s minds so that
              when they require your products or services, you are the go-to
              people. Marketing your business is a necessity. Putting your name
              and logo out there and keeping it there is a must. This lets
              clients know that you are “still around” and in business.
              Frequency is a good way to achieve the “stand out factor” in
              recognition. I am reminded of both television and radio ads I had
              heard of in the past. They run continually with a catch phrase or
              musical jingle over and over again on the radio or television
              until you are absolutely sick of hearing it. You also cannot get
              it out of your head. Although this type of advertising is
              expensive, it can be very effective, and the recognition factor is
              quite high. Television and radio can reach a large audience, and
              they are broad in their appeal. In a brief sentence, you are
              paying to market to both those that are your potential customers
              and a large segment of those who are not now and probably never
              will be your customers. There are more economical ways to pursue
              frequency, the point is to define your target market demographic,
              and invest your marketing funds into the locations that will best
              be seen by them. Another factor to consider is “can I market
              myself in a place where I will stand out from my competition, or
              where my competition does not have a presence?” Why would you
              market yourself in a flyer or newspaper right beside your
              competition and risk blending into a crowd, and ultimately being
              ignored? Another issue to look at is diversification. As the
              saying goes, “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”. When you
              look at your advertising budget for the year, try to find the
              affordable solutions that will continue to reap during the full
              year of your advertising budget. An expensive radio or television
              promotion may give short term gains for that weekend sale, but
              what about the rest of the year? Your clients may end up with the
              impression of where did they go, I haven’t seen or heard anything
              about them for so long. Don’t always look for the old standbys in
              marketing, but keep your eyes and ears open for the latest and
              greatest ways to market your business. With the costs of
              technology coming down dramatically new options such as digital
              advertising on LCD and Plasma screens are becoming more and more
              affordable, and the paper billboards and posters becoming a thing
              of the past.

                    Free directories: directories are perfect for customers that
                    are... searching for a particular topic. What’s great about
                    them is that you only have to post once and they are good
                    for long periods of time. It saves a lot of your time when
                    you don’t have to resubmit your information every week or
                    every month. The bad news is most of your traffic won’t come
                    from here. I still feel it is worth it to get your link out
                    there. Just take one day and set it aside for posting to
                    free directories. You won’t need to do it again for at least
                    6 months. 2. Classified Ads: These are great for work from
                    home businesses. Think about it. Where do people go when
                    they are looking for a job? That’s right-the classifieds.
                    The only downside to classified ads is that you have to
                    resubmit them quite frequently. Once you find which
                    classifieds bring you the most traffic you can concentrate
                    on them and weed the others out. So it is really more time
                    consuming in the beginning, and doesn’t have to be later on
                    when you get the hang of things. 3. Free article
                    submissions/ezines: The best way to inform others about your
                    product or service is to write an article about it. In your
                    authors resource box, you can tell readers about yourself
                    and where they can go to check out your product or service.
                    This is also an excellent way to get free links to your site
                    if you have one. There are a lot of webmasters out there who
                    are looking for good articles they can post on their site.
                    If they post yours, that is another site that is doing the
                    advertising for you. All for free. 4. URL Submissions:
                    Probably the quickest and easiest thing to do to advertise
                    your site. Just type “Free URL submission” in your search
                    engine. When you get a list just enter the URL you are
                    promoting and click submit. That’s it. It only takes a few
                    seconds and your done. Just set a day aside once every 3
                    months and do this. 5. Forum Posts: Put your product or
                    service website in your signature file when you sign up on
                    some forums. It will be displayed every time you make a
                    post. Try to look for topics that you have some knowledge
                    on, and can give a relevant answer too. Do not spam anyone,
                    you will get kicked off the forum and you will get a bad
                    reputation. Get involved asking and answering questions that
                    pertain to your area of business. Forums are great because
                    once you make a post it stays there forever. It will get
                    moved to the archives eventually, but someone could still
                    find it if they were searching the archives. Yes, there are
                    many people who do. 6. Traffic Exchanges: Probably the most
                    time consuming way to advertise for free, but definately the
                    most effective. Most forums I have visited have said in many
                    posts that they received a lot of their profit from traffic
                    exchanges. If you don’t want to spend the time surfing for
                    credits, you do have the option of buying them. I would look
                    into a program that lets you surf multiple websites at once
                    like crazy browser. There are others and they are free to
                    download. That way you can just spend one hour a day and get
                    all your surfing in at once. 7. News-groups: Become involved
                    in a group that has to do with your kind of business. You
                    can usually mail the group once per day, but I would
                    encourage you to find something fresh to talk about each
                    day. People will tune you out if they see the same message
                    all the time. Remember to never Spam anyone. Only join
                    groups with the same interests as yours. In other words,
                    don’t sign up for a recipe swapping group when you are
                    advertising shaving cream.

                    Hypnotize Yourself Into The Ghost
                  </h3>
                  <p class="news-slide__text">
                    There are many things that are important to catalog
                    design.... Your images must be sharp and appealing. Your
                    text and even the font you use for the text is important.
                    The cover page design and the design of your catalog’s
                    product pages all play important roles in designing a
                    catalog that will bring in new customers and sales. However
                    none of the things mentioned above are more important than
                    the type of paper you will choose to print your catalog on.
                    The “feel” of your catalog is important to your potential
                    customers. The longer they have your catalog in their hands,
                    the more product they will buy. In this article I will go
                    over some of the many paper choices you have to print your
                    catalog on. First you need to decide if the cover will be
                    the same paper as the rest of your catalog. In most cases
                    the cover will be of heavier weight then the interior pages.
                    Second you will need to choose coated or uncoated paper for
                    printing your catalog. Coated paper is for the glossier
                    layouts and uncoated is more economical, but can still
                    display your products well. So you have two things to
                    consider first, “Will it be glossy paper or not?”, “Will my
                    cover be the same weight as the interior pages of my
                    catalog?” Once you have answered those two questions the
                    next decision is what the weight of the paper will be. Most
                    catalogs go with 60, 70, or 80 lb. weights. So it would be
                    60lb uncoated or coated, 70 lb. Coated or uncoated. 80 lb.
                    Paper usually is only chosen for 80 lb. Weight and above.
                    Also, not all paper is measured by weight. Some is measured
                    by thickness or “points”. Now the above is really
                    over-simplified. There are other types of special paper you
                    can choose from. There is textured paper, photographic
                    paper, and other more expensive paper to choose from if you
                    are selling a high-end or expensive product. There are also
                    other considerations when choosing the paper your catalog
                    will be printed on. Such as the method of printing you are
                    going to choose. If you are going to have your catalog
                    printed on a hot-set web press, then you can choose uncoated
                    or coated paper. The heat will dry the ink as it prints your
                    catalog. If your printer uses a cold-set web press then the
                    ink air-dries and is absorbed into the paper. A cold-set web
                    press cannot print on coated paper. If your printer uses a
                    sheet-fed press then you can choose from any of the high
                    quality papers they have available. The same goes for
                    printers that do digital printing. It will depend a lot on
                    the printer you choose. You need to find out what type of
                    paper is available and you will want to see samples of the
                    paper to get a better idea of which one you want to print
                    your catalog on. Also ask your printer to suggest the
                    different types of paper they think will be the best for
                    your catalog. Here is a list of some of the types of paper
                    your printer may have available for you to choose from or
                    may be able to order for you. Dull Coated Paper Matte Coated
                    Paper Glossy Coated Paper Antique Paper Vellum Paper Wove
                    Paper Smooth Paper Felt Paper Linen Paper Fiber-added Paper
                    Laid Paper Parchment Four things determine the quality of
                    the paper, opacity, brightness, finish, and ppi. (Pounds per
                    inch) Brightness affects the contrast and brilliance of the
                    paper. It affects how your text will stand out on the pages
                    of your catalog. Opacity is how much your ink is visible
                    from the back of the page. If a paper is too opaque, your
                    text and images from one page will be seen through onto
                    another page that your customer is trying to read. The
                    finish affects the feel of the pages and also how your
                    images will look. The lower grade finishes produce grainier
                    images while high quality finishes sharpen the look of your
                    images. Ask your printer to provide you with samples or
                    swatch booklets and a price list for printing your catalog
                    on the various types of paper before you decide. You know
                    what your budget is and paper is only one of the expenses
                    you have to consider.

                    Free directories: directories are perfect for customers that
                    are... searching for a particular topic. What’s great about
                    them is that you only have to post once and they are good
                    for long periods of time. It saves a lot of your time when
                    you don’t have to resubmit your information every week or
                    every month. The bad news is most of your traffic won’t come
                    from here. I still feel it is worth it to get your link out
                    there. Just take one day and set it aside for posting to
                    free directories. You won’t need to do it again for at least
                    6 months. 2. Classified Ads: These are great for work from
                    home businesses. Think about it. Where do people go when
                    they are looking for a job? That’s right-the classifieds.
                    The only downside to classified ads is that you have to
                    resubmit them quite frequently. Once you find which
                    classifieds bring you the most traffic you can concentrate
                    on them and weed the others out. So it is really more time
                    consuming in the beginning, and doesn’t have to be later on
                    when you get the hang of things. 3. Free article
                    submissions/ezines: The best way to inform others about your
                    product or service is to write an article about it. In your
                    authors resource box, you can tell readers about yourself
                    and where they can go to check out your product or service.
                    This is also an excellent way to get free links to your site
                    if you have one. There are a lot of webmasters out there who
                    are looking for good articles they can post on their site.
                    If they post yours, that is another site that is doing the
                    advertising for you. All for free. 4. URL Submissions:
                    Probably the quickest and easiest thing to do to advertise
                    your site. Just type “Free URL submission” in your search
                    engine. When you get a list just enter the URL you are
                    promoting and click submit. That’s it. It only takes a few
                    seconds and your done. Just set a day aside once every 3
                    months and do this. 5. Forum Posts: Put your product or
                    service website in your signature file when you sign up on
                    some forums. It will be displayed every time you make a
                    post. Try to look for topics that you have some knowledge
                    on, and can give a relevant answer too. Do not spam anyone,
                    you will get kicked off the forum and you will get a bad
                    reputation. Get involved asking and answering questions that
                    pertain to your area of business. Forums are great because
                    once you make a post it stays there forever. It will get
                    moved to the archives eventually, but someone could still
                    find it if they were searching the archives. Yes, there are
                    many people who do. 6. Traffic Exchanges: Probably the most
                    time consuming way to advertise for free, but definately the
                    most effective. Most forums I have visited have said in many
                    posts that they received a lot of their profit from traffic
                    exchanges. If you don’t want to spend the time surfing for
                    credits, you do have the option of buying them. I would look
                    into a program that lets you surf multiple websites at once
                    like crazy browser. There are others and they are free to
                    download. That way you can just spend one hour a day and get
                    all your surfing in at once. 7. News-groups: Become involved
                    in a group that has to do with your kind of business. You
                    can usually mail the group once per day, but I would
                    encourage you to find something fresh to talk about each
                    day. People will tune you out if they see the same message
                    all the time. Remember to never Spam anyone. Only join
                    groups with the same interests as yours. In other words,
                    don’t sign up for a recipe swapping group when you are
                    advertising shaving cream.
